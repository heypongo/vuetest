# Technical test - Frontent

The main goal of this test is to estimate your technical knowledge on Vue and Tailwind. You will create a small web app using [Yelp API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3) called "WhatsNext" to display to someone landing to NYC (called Mark) all the restaurants around him. We'll let Mark book the restaurant he chose in the app.

## Prerequisites

- NodeJS `^16.14.0`
- A fork of the Vuetest project
- The [Yelp API documentation](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3)

## Exercise

#### Workflow

- Mark's travel agency is testing a new service for their customers, allowing them to find easily partner restaurants around their hotel
- Before his flight, Mark has been invited by the travel agency to scan a QRCode printed on his booking tickets
- The QRCode leads him to a page that lists all the restaurants around his hotel **Moxy NYC Times Square,** located in 485 7th Ave, New York, NY 10018
- Mark can browse all the restaurants and order in one of them with Yelp
- Mark can use the app with his mobile but also with his laptop

#### To Do

- In this test, we'll ask you to create two screens :
    - Restaurants list
    - Detail of a restaurant

- Restaurants list (it can be the home page)
  - Name of the restaurant
  - Picture
  - Categories (eg : Bagels)
  - all additional information that you think is useful to the user (and available in the API)

- Detail of a restaurant
  - *all the restaurants list information*
  - additional pictures of the restaurant
  - all additional information that you think is useful to the user (and available in the API)

## Deliverable

- You must make [a Pull Request](https://github.com/heypongo/vuetest/pulls) in this Github Repository containing your work on the project

## Useful links

- **[Yelp API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3)**
- **[Tailwind Components](https://tailwindui.com/components)**

## Tips

- We know that you are not a UX/UI Designer, don't worry 😜
- Nevertheless, we want you to try to create screens from scratch and make them as user-friendly as you can
- Tailwind will help you to create clean UI easily
- We know that technical tests can be time-consuming, especially if you have multiple tests to pass at the same time. If the test is too time-consuming for you, don't hesitate to keep in touch and we'll find ways to make it lighter 😉
